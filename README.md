# perceptron

`perceptron.py` implements a perceptron object from scratch using only Numpy as its base module. Data from Kaggle in the form of medical data on patients with diabetes is included as an example. Features of the `Perceptron` object include regularization, cross-entropy loss, the delta rule, and modifiable parameters (e.g., the learning rate alpha).

While the code is original, the equations were gleaned from Coursera and the following [lecture notes](http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/courses/CSC9YF/lectures/ANN/3-DeltaRule.pdf).
